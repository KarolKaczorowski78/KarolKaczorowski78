## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Karol

### âš¡ Who am I?
#### I'm a young and ambicious man from Cracow. My journey with programming began in high school. Back then I didn't really know what to do for living, I decided to start learning programming. Even though I wasn't enthusiastic about it I kept doing it. After some time I realized that computer science is one of the most awesome and interesting fields of science. My curiosity was growing in line with knowledge, every piece of information was like a key which opened another locker containing opportunity. Beside programming I love spending my time training, I'm incredibly passioned about martial arts, I train 6 times a week and it brings a perfect harmony to my life and keeps me motivated on the daily basis.
